# EXPENSES MANAGER

This web application gives you a clean, basic and minimal interface to track your **Incomes** and **Expenses**. It was developed using React and vanilla CSS.

## Features
* Add and remove Incomes/Expenses
* It shows the TOP Income/expense
* Responsive design for desktops, tablets and mobiles

## Code features
* ReactJS
* PropTypes
* Testing with Jest/Enzyme
* CI/CD using:
    * GitHub for repository
    * Travis-ci for Continuos Integration
    * Heroku for deployment

I really like the CI/CD portion of this app far from the app functionality and design themself. I just need to push the code to GitHub, then Travis does the testing and if everything pass, then it confirms the commmit on GitHub and Heroku pulls the **master** branch to deploy the new code. Neat.
